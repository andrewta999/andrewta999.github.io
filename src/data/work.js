This project aided my team of scientists and engineers in their researches and removed the need of a third-party software that costed 100 thousands dollars per year. I was in charged of both building the backend (a Rest API) that connected to the instruments and a web browser interface that communicated with the backend to display data to users. I used PostgreSQL to store the data from the instruments. The project was deployed with Docker and Kubernetes.",
